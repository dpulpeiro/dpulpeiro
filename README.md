👋 I am Daniel, born in Ribadeo, during my childhood I dedicated myself with other children from the village to build all kinds of things boats, rail cars, cabins... anything was worth it if the process was going to be exciting.

When I was a teenager I became fond of canoeing 🛶 , a sport that I have practiced ever since and of which I am the coach of a competition team and monitor in [ CientoVolando](https://100tovolando.eu), a leisure and free time company that makes tours descending the Eo river. 

At the age of 18 I came to La Coruña where I studied Computer Engineering and other courses such as [![ Santander Explorer ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dpulpeiro/dpulpeiro/main/images/santander.png) Santander Explorer](https://explorerbyx.org/en/) or [![ Google Activate ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dpulpeiro/dpulpeiro/main/images/google.png) Google Activate](https://learndigital.withgoogle.com/activate/)  with a view to being able to develop online projects.

For the last 3 years I have been working at the [Galician Institute of Technology](https://itg.es/en/) in projects mainly related Computer Vision, Natural Languaje Processing and Time Series Forecasting, where I developed a broad knowledge among some of the most used technologies nowadays.

👀 Among my hobbies are sports 💪, software development 💻, traveling ✈ and any kind of adventure in the nature 🐒🌲.

🌱 I’m currently working on one of my personal projects: [AnHous.com](https://anhous.com), A website made to get insights about the spanish housing market🏠.
